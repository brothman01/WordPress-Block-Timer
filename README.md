# WordPress-Block-Timer - Ben Rothman
I made this simple stopwatch block to explore using different technologies to make blocks for WordPress.  I have used React, PHP, CSS, SASS and Vanilla Javascript to build react blocks.  I have also built react blocks for both the native block editor (Gutenberg) and Visual Composer.  This particular block uses PHP and vanilla javascript to create a stopwatch-like timer for the native WordPress block editor.

This was just an experiment.
